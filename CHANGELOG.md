All notable changes to Open Speech are documented here.
Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Security
- Security hardening (Sentinel review): safe Vosk zip extraction (Zip Slip prevention), realtime buffer limits + idle timeout, startup auth warning + `OS_AUTH_REQUIRED`, WebSocket origin allowlist (`OS_WS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`), Wyoming bind host (`OS_WYOMING_HOST` default `127.0.0.1`), voice clone upload size guard, query-string API key deprecation warning, non-root Docker user, hardened TLS cert dir/permissions, and model-management locking improvements.

### Fixed
- Made app version reporting single-source and dynamic: `/health` now returns runtime package version (`importlib.metadata`) with safe fallback, and `HealthResponse.version` is no longer hardcoded.

### Added
- Phase 7a: Qwen3-TTS deep integration:
  - Rewrote `qwen3_backend.py` to use official `qwen-tts` (`Qwen3TTSModel`)
  - Three-model on-demand auto-selection: `CustomVoice`, `VoiceDesign`, `Base`
  - Added 9 premium Qwen speakers with language auto-detection
  - Instruction control passthrough (`voice_design` -> `instruct`)
  - Voice cloning integration with `create_voice_clone_prompt()` in-memory cache
  - Added Qwen3 config envs: `TTS_QWEN3_SIZE`, `TTS_QWEN3_FLASH_ATTN`, `TTS_QWEN3_DEVICE`
  - Added Qwen3 model variants to registry (`qwen3-tts/...` IDs + tokenizer)
  - Updated qwen optional dependency to `qwen-tts>=0.1.0`
  - Web UI Speak tab now includes Qwen-oriented speaker/language/voice_design controls
- Python client SDK upgrades:
  - `stream_transcribe()` now uses `/v1/audio/stream?vad=true` WebSocket protocol with sync + async support, event streaming, and reconnect handling.
  - `realtime_session()` now returns fully functional sync + async realtime session objects (`send_audio`, `commit`, `create_response`, `on_transcript`, `on_audio`, `on_vad`, `close`).
- New JS/TS client package scaffold at `client-js/` (`@open-speech/client`) with STT/TTS helpers, stream transcription, realtime session API, PCM conversion utilities, reconnection flow, and usage docs.
- Added `requirements.lock` with pinned core dependencies for reproducible installs.
- Web UI Transcribe tab improvements:
  - live audio level meter,
  - partial transcript stream panel,
  - VAD status indicator,
  - clearly separated final transcript + copy button,
  - duration and processing-time metrics.
- Added client SDK WebSocket unit tests for sync/async streaming + realtime protocol messages.
- **OpenAI Realtime API** — WebSocket endpoint at `/v1/realtime` for drop-in compatibility
  with OpenAI Realtime API clients (audio I/O only — STT + TTS, no LLM)
  - Session management (`session.create`, `session.update`)
  - Input audio buffer with append/commit/clear and server VAD auto-commit
  - Transcription via active STT backend on audio commit
  - TTS response streaming via `response.create` → `response.audio.delta` events
  - Audio format negotiation: pcm16 (24kHz), g711_ulaw, g711_alaw (8kHz)
  - Server VAD mode using Silero VAD from Phase 5b
  - Enable/disable with `OS_REALTIME_ENABLED` (default: true)
- **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)** — Silero VAD integration for speech detection
  - ONNX-based (<2MB model, MIT licensed), no PyTorch dependency
  - VAD-gated WebSocket STT — only forwards speech to backend, saving compute
  - `speech_start` / `speech_end` events sent to WebSocket clients
  - Configurable: `STT_VAD_ENABLED`, `STT_VAD_THRESHOLD`, `STT_VAD_MIN_SPEECH_MS`, `STT_VAD_SILENCE_MS`
  - `vad=true/false` query parameter on WebSocket endpoint
  - Web UI mic now shows recording states: listening → speech detected → processing
  - Wyoming STT handler uses VAD to filter silence before transcription
  - New module: `src/vad/` with `SileroVAD` wrapper, `is_speech()`, `get_speech_segments()`
- **Wyoming Protocol Support** — async TCP server (port 10400) for Home Assistant integration
  - Open Speech is now a drop-in STT + TTS provider for Home Assistant voice pipelines
  - Enable with `OS_WYOMING_ENABLED=true`, configure port with `OS_WYOMING_PORT`
  - Supports `Describe`, `Transcribe`, and `Synthesize` events
  - Audio resampled to Wyoming standard (16kHz, 16-bit, mono)
  - Runs alongside existing HTTP/WebSocket API on separate port

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- Standardized HTTP error envelope across API and middleware responses to `{"error": "..."}`.
- Replaced ad-hoc `JSONResponse({"error": ...})` branches in TTS endpoints with `HTTPException` plus a unified exception handler.
- Synced README API endpoint table with all implemented routes in `src/main.py`.
- Added full OS_*/STT_*/TTS_* environment variable reference in README.
- Corrected README Qwen3 model IDs to match `src/model_registry.py` (`qwen3-tts/...`).
- Added missing `STT_MODEL_DIR` documentation entry to `.env.example`.
- Harmonized `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.cpu.yml`, and `docker-compose.gpu.yml` env coverage, ports, and volume mounts using non-root container paths.
- Expanded runtime tests for `src/streaming.py` session lifecycle, VAD flow, mid-stream disconnects, and error propagation.

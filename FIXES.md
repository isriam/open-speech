## Bugs

| # | Description | Status | Commit |
|---|-------------|--------|--------|
| B1 | Mic transcription captures nothing (WebSocket/format issue) | 🟡 | c128533 (partial) |
| B2 | Piper backend passes `length_scale` kwarg rejected by current piper-tts API → synthesis fails with "# channels not specified" | 🟢 | e19eea3 |
| B3 | WebSocket library missing — uvicorn starts without `websockets`/`wsproto`, mic streaming broken. Fix: add `websockets` to Dockerfile deps + pyproject extras. Log: `WARNING: No supported WebSocket library detected` | 🟢 | — |
| B4 | `/v1/audio/stream` endpoint returns 404 (GET with query params). Likely route not registered or WebSocket upgrade fails silently before route match. Related to B3. | 🟢 | 8bfe6f9 |
| B5 | Piper `synthesize()` ignores requested model — always uses first loaded. `voice` param = model_id but code just grabs first key from `self._loaded` dict (line 187). Should match `voice` to loaded model key. | 🟢 | c2f47b0 |
| B6 | Provider install (`/api/providers/install`) installs packages to `~/.local` instead of system site-packages. Server can't import them. Cause: `pip install --user` default when not root. Fix: use `pip install --target` or `sys.executable -m pip install` pointing at the right site-packages dir. **Also:** when kokoro is installed, must run `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm` (misaki phonemizer dep) — baked into CPU image but not GPU image. | 🟢 | ee712e4 |
| B7 | Inconsistent API error envelope — some endpoints return `{"error":"..."}` others `{"detail":"..."}` (FastAPI HTTPException default). Standardize all to `{"error":{"message":"..."}}`. See PROJECT-REVIEW.md section 1. | 🟢 | f3bde86 |
| B8 | README API table missing many implemented endpoints (`/v1/realtime`, `/api/ps`, `/v1/audio/models/*`, `/api/tts/capabilities`, etc). README env var docs missing ~15 active config knobs. See PROJECT-REVIEW.md sections 2+4+8. | 🟡 | — |
| B9 | **Streaming TTS blocks event loop** — `_generate()` calls `_do_synthesize()` synchronously when `stream=True` (no `run_in_executor`). Non-streaming path correctly uses executor (line 803). Heavy models (Qwen3, XTTS) will stall all concurrent requests during synthesis. **File:** `src/main.py:772-779`. Fix: wrap streaming synthesis in `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor()`. | 🟢 | already implemented |
| B10 | **TTS cache key missing model** — Cache key is `(text, voice, speed, format)` but omits the active model. Switching TTS backends (e.g. kokoro → piper) with same voice name returns stale cached audio from wrong backend. **File:** `src/cache/tts_cache.py` + `src/main.py:797-800`. Fix: add model/backend name to cache key. | 🟢 | 6b2aab0 |
| B11 | **`inspect.signature` called on every TTS request** — `_do_synthesize()` calls `inspect.signature()` at runtime for every request with `voice_design` or `reference_audio`. Slow (reflection) and fragile. **File:** `src/main.py:756-770`. Fix: use backend `capabilities` dict instead. | 🟢 | a56d033 |
| B12 | Frontend model auto-prepare race: provider install API was fire-and-forget polling, so Generate/Transcribe could continue before install completed and fail with confusing state errors. | 🟢 | pending |

| F14 | Manual model lifecycle: provider install/download/load/unload/delete with actionable errors | 🟢 | pending |
| F15 | UX/model-flow rescue pass: auto-prepare on Generate/Transcribe, `ensureModelReady(modelId)`, capability-aware advanced controls, focused defaults (kokoro/piper + faster-whisper), and cleaner status-driven UI | 🟢 | pending |

*To add: just tell Will in Discord. He'll add it here and batch dispatch to Forge.*
| B30 | **qwen3-tts Install button resets — no feedback, reverts to Install** — Clicking Install on qwen3-tts in the Providers list shows no spinner, no progress, no error — button just bounces back to "Install". Root cause: B26 (missing `qwen-tts>=0.1.0` in `PROVIDER_INSTALL_SPECS["qwen3"]`) causes the pip install subprocess to fail silently. The UI now keeps an error-state retry button and shows inline error text on failure. | 🟢 | 90f722e |
| B29 | **Voice Effects checkboxes misaligned — controls appear but are non-functional** — Voice Effects section now uses tight inline label+checkbox controls with full clickable labels; layout no longer spreads checkbox and text apart. | 🟢 | 90f722e |
| B28 | **Models tab empty on load, 30s timeout before populating** — `/api/models` is fetched once at init; STT/TTS loaders consume cache, and non-critical startup loaders are non-blocking via settled promises. Added simple loading placeholders to STT/TTS selectors. | 🟢 | 90f722e |
| B27 | **Unloading model doesn't release VRAM** — Added `gc.collect()` + CUDA cache emptying in affected unload paths (kokoro, qwen3 backend, faster-whisper) to mirror working backends. | 🟢 | 90f722e |
| B26 | **Qwen3-TTS install missing `qwen-tts` package** — Added `qwen-tts>=0.1.0` install spec and corrected install guidance message in qwen3 backend import error. | 🟢 | 90f722e |
| B13 | **Speak tab model selector confusing** — Model dropdown shows full registry paths (`piper/en_US-ryan-medium`) mixing provider+model+voice into one field. Should be three separate dropdowns: Provider (installed TTS only) → Voice (for that provider) → Preset. Defaults to wrong/missing model instead of loaded model. | 🟢 | f21169c |
| B14 | **TTS model state never reaches `downloaded`** — `list_all()` checks HF cache for STT models via `list_cached_models()` but always passes `is_downloaded=False` for TTS models. After provider install, kokoro/piper stays `provider_installed` forever even if weights are already cached. Fix: (1) backend — wire `_candidate_artifact_paths()` into `list_all()` for TTS models, set `is_downloaded=True` if any artifact path exists. (2) UX follow-up — explicit **Cache (prefetch)** action + clearer model-state messaging (installed vs cached vs loaded), plus bake-time provider/model controls in Docker. | 🟢 | 6cfb90d + UX follow-up |

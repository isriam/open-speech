## Bugs

| # | Description | Status | Commit |
|---|-------------|--------|--------|
| B1 | Mic transcription captures nothing (WebSocket/format issue) | 🟡 | c128533 (partial) |
| B2 | Piper backend passes `length_scale` kwarg rejected by current piper-tts API → synthesis fails with "# channels not specified" | 🟢 | e19eea3 |
| B3 | WebSocket library missing — uvicorn starts without `websockets`/`wsproto`, mic streaming broken. Fix: add `websockets` to Dockerfile deps + pyproject extras. Log: `WARNING: No supported WebSocket library detected` | 🟢 | — |
| B4 | `/v1/audio/stream` endpoint returns 404 (GET with query params). Likely route not registered or WebSocket upgrade fails silently before route match. Related to B3. | 🟢 | — |
